## Backup

Until now I had been only manually backing up ocassionally :(. So, I figured this is a good time to get on the ball and automate my backups.

I googled linux backup solutions which brought me to the [System76 backup files page](https://support.system76.com/articles/backup-files/), so I decided to try
[Déjà Dup](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/DejaDup). Installed via one liner:

```bash
sudo apt install deja-dup
```

Fired it up and configured it in a jiff. Easy peasy. Offers options to backup to local or cloud storage!
I'm backing up to a WD external hard drive.

## The battery

yikes!

I was a little nervous as I've not operated on bare metal in several years, but here it goes!

The battery:
