So excited to announce my first drupal to backdrop module port <span class="inline-code">redirect</span>.  You can find it, download it, and install it on your backdrop install here: https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/redirect
</p>

<p>
Of course special thanks to the drupal authors and maintainers of the drupal <a href="http://drupal.org/project/redirect">redirect</a> module.
</p>

Working on this port was great fun and a great learning experience!  If you want to work on a port you can find some guidelines and a nice video over at <a href="https://api.backdropcms.org/converting-modules-from-drupal">https://api.backdropcms.org/converting-modules-from-drupal</a>.  You can also get great general info at <a href="https://api.backdropcms.org/">Backdrop CMS API</a>

And of course one of my favourite parts of working on backdrop is the #dev team; special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/quicksketch">@quicksketch</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jenlampton">@jenlampton</a> for mentoring.  Come join us on irc #backdrop channel on freenode.
