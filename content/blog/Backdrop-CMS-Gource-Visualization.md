I ported the <code class="inline">video_embed_field</code> to <a href="https://backdropcms.org">Backdrop CMS</a> it is released on github here: <a href="https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/video_embed_field">Video Embed Field</a>.  So, of course I had to whip up a quick post to test/use the video embed field.  This is it: <code class="inline">m e t a</code>

This is a visualization of Backdrop CMS software development from Monday 20 January 2014 to Thursday 6 August 2015.  It has been fun to participate in this open source project and this visualization is fun to look at.
